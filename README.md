UNCC Week 1 Refactoring Job Ticket

The attached website was refactored to better meet accessibility standards. The HTML code is now using semantic elements, so that the code is better understood. Each image has a working link and accessible description. The overall structure of the CSS code is now more organized, with notes saying what each section of code is.

Below are screenshots of the deployed website application
